Fail2Ban Webinterface (f2bwi)
Monitoring fail2ban and manually ban / release IP's

- get your fail2ban and jails running, if not already done
- unpack archive and put contents to your webspace
- protect this script, use at least .htaccess auth or ip allow/deny rules
- allow use of "exec()" php function for this script if restricted
- edit config.inc.php to your needs
- run this script to check if socket access is ok
- maybe you need to change the file /etc/init.d/fail2ban to this:
  at the end of "function do_start()" before the line "return 0" put
  "chmod 766 $SOCKFILE" to make the socket r/w for webserver user
  and then restart fail2ban
- run the script with your browser
